        <h2>Chapter 1: About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Stephanie Ramos and I am studying in software development. I grew up in
            Southern California where I enjoy the warm weather and sunny beaches. 
            <span class="sentence">Family has always been one of the most important parts of my life.</span>
        </p>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I also enjoy playing games, which help me 
            relax and stay creative. These activities are a great balance to my schoolwork.
        </p>
        <p>I look forward to working in technology and building a useful solution through code.
            Problem-solving is one of my passions, and I enjoy learning new programming skills.
            Each class helps me feel more confident about my career path.
        </p>
        <p> Outside of school, I love spending time with my husband and family. We enjoy traveling
            and making memories together. Those experiences bring me happiness and motivation.
